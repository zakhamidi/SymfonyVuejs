installing Vuejs with > npm install -g vue-cli
creat vue project > vue init webpack vuejsapp
to run the app server > npm run dev
Or we can <script src="use https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
otherwise we can use axios cdn > <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
in my html (index.html)
I used bootstrap for buttons
I created test.js to test the vue

and for pwa for a responsive website that we can use on any platforme we have to istall it
. > vue init pwa apivuejs
  > npm istall
  > npm run dev
I had a problem with npm run dev so I used the vue.j use CDN but I would love to do that and I am able to do it
